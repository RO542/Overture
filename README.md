Overture is a lightweight, easy to use, desktop music player and jellyfin client users with large music libraries.

Why have a desktop music player ?
With the prevalence of streaming services, many people primarily stream music from popular services which are great for those who use them.
This has left a gap in interest for offline desktop music players which are still very useful for users who often have extensive offline libraries and just want a basic application with decent user interface to play them. In short, this application aims to be a featureful alternative to stock OS music players.

Why have a jellfyin desktop client ?
There exist many jellyfin clients optimized for viewing video both on desktop and mobile platforms, but few are aimed at providing a good listening and browsing experience for a jellyfin client on the desktop.
